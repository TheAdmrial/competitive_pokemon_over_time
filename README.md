# competitive_pokemon_over_time

This project is to graph the competitive ranking of pokemon across the generations (across time). 

## Data Sources
The data for the Pokemon is coming from pokemondb.net for the list of Pokemon. 
The data for the individual Pokemon rankings comes from smogon. 

## Note about regional variants
I will be categorizing regional variants as different Pokemon. This won't matter until Gen 7.
